Technimatic is easy my favorite Drum and Bass Duo. Pete's & Andy's debut record [*Desire Paths*](http://www.shogunaudio.co.uk/shop/technimatic-desire-paths-lp-mp3-1) from last summer [has been blasting](http://www.lastfm.de/user/Balauue/library/music/Technimatic/Desire+Paths?sortOrder=desc&sortBy=plays) on my stereo for weeks, not counting the vinyl plays. They first had my attention when they came up with [the evening loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8USr9UN7-g). Their distinct style is just like everything falls into place, everything is floating along.
