I am proud to be part of the <a href="https://www.wi-net.de">WINet Wirtschaftsinformatik-Netzwerk Münster</a>. We are a network for Information Systems people from Münster. Our goal is connecting like-minded people and foster dialogue between students, researchers and professionals. 

We do seminars, trainings, and workshops for students and members. By offering frequent IS tables across Germany, we bring together IS people. We provide a scholarship and financial support for IS students @ WWU Münster. Last but not least, we support almost all student events such as the annual Summer festival, the [IS lan party](http://www.wi-lanparty.de/), graduation ceremony and the [ERCIS launchpad](http://www.ercis-launchpad.de/).
