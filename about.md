Hej, I'm Jan!

I am a PhD student and soon-to-be researcher in Information Systems at the [Chair for Information Systems and Information Management](https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/department/groups/is/profile) of Prof. Jörg Becker at the [European Research Center for Information Systems](https://www.ercis.org) in Münster, Germany.

## Weggerockt Development
 
When not studying, I do software development and IT-consulting for small and medium-sized enterprises, and universities with my company *Weggerockt Development*.

I am fond of building IT architectures, CRM solutions, IS for research and teaching, and doing web development for small businesses. Below you find some of my customers.

<a href="https://www.wi-net.de"><img style="float:left;margin-right:1em" width="400" src="/assets/images/about/winet@2x.png" /></a>

I am proud to be part of the <a href="https://www.wi-net.de">WINet Wirtschaftsinformatik-Netzwerk Münster</a>. We are a network for Information Systems people at the WWU Münster. Our goal is connecting like-minded people and foster dialogue between students, researchers and professionals. 

We do seminars, trainings, and workshops for students and members that look beyond the regular IS courses. You can meet old and new friends at one of our frequent IS tables across Germany. We provide a scholarship and financial support for IS students at the WWU Münster. Last but not least, we support almost all student events there, such as the annual Summer festival, the [IS lan party](http://www.wi-lanparty.de/), graduation ceremony and the [ERCIS launchpad](http://www.ercis-launchpad.de/).
